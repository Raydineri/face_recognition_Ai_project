### Data Source
- **Wikidata** - Open database for player information via SPARQL queries

## 🔧 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Camera (optional, for live recognition)

### Step-by-step Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dachraoui-ui/face_recognition_with_gui.git
cd face_recognition_Ai_project
```

2. **Create virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install required dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install manually:
```bash
pip install face_recognition
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install requests
```

4. **Prepare the face database**
```bash
python fetch_players.py  # Fetch player data from Wikidata
python pre_encode.py     # Generate face encodings
```

5. **Run the application**
```bash
python main.py
```

### System Requirements
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 10.14+, Linux Ubuntu 18.04+

## 🎮 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Launch the application** by running `main.py`
2. **Click "Upload and Process Image"** to select an image file
3. **View results** - The system will:
   - Detect faces in the uploaded image
   - Compare with known Premier League players
   - Display player information (name, age, height)
   - Show bounding boxes around recognized faces

### Supported Image Formats
- `.jpg`, `.jpeg`
- `.png`
- `.bmp`
- `.gif`

### Example Usage
```python
# For developers wanting to integrate the recognition engine
from main import FaceRecognitionApp

app = FaceRecognitionApp()
result = app.recognize_face("path/to/player/image.jpg")
print(f"Player: {result['name']}, Age: {result['age']}")
```

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Collection
- **Source**: Wikidata using SPARQL queries
- **Volume**: Up to 6,000 entries from Premier League
- **Format**: Player names, teams, and image URLs
- **Quality Control**: Automated image validation and filtering

### AI Model Selection
The project evaluated multiple approaches:

| Method | Pros | Cons | Selected |
|--------|------|------|----------|
| **KNN** | Simple implementation | Limited scalability | ❌ |
| **SVM** | Good for high-dimensional data | Slower processing | ❌ |
| **Face Encoding + Euclidean Distance** | Real-time performance, High accuracy | - | ✅ |

**Selected Approach Features:**
- 128-dimensional face vectors
- Real-time performance
- High accuracy with optimal computational efficiency
- Robust to lighting variations

### Infrastructure
- **Hardware**: AMD Ryzen 5, NVIDIA RTX 3050, 16GB RAM
- **Development**: PyCharm IDE
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub

## 📈 Results

   - Scalability concerns with very large databases
   - Requires good lighting conditions

3. **Model Limitations**
   - Potential overfitting with limited training data
   - Challenges generalizing to new, unseen faces
   - Sensitivity to image preprocessing

## 🔮 Future Perspectives

### 🎯 Planned Improvements
- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Collect higher quality, diverse images per player
- **Advanced Models**: Explore deep CNN architectures for better recognition
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error correction mechanisms
- **Performance Optimization**: GPU acceleration for faster processing

### 🚀 Potential Extensions
